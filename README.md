# Line Segment Detection

This repo is created to describe the project `Rebar Line Segment Detection` conducted from Dec. 2020 to now between [CyberCore AI](https://cybercore.co.jp/) and [TODA Construction](https://www.toda.co.jp/english/). <br/>
The code is belongs into CyberCore AI. 
## Requirements <br/>
- Image size: 2208 x 1920 (RGB/gray-scale).
- Support D10 to D51 rebars in the 0.5m to 2.5m range.
- Small model with acceptable accuracy and run at least 10 fps on CPU i5-9400.

## Role
Team member of a team with 2 people. I mainly focus on developing/modifying a fast and robust model, pre-processing dataset, and implement many loss functions.
## Results
In process.
### Model benchmark
Test on PC: 6-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9400 CPU @ 2.90GHz, 16 GiB RAM
Model run with 4 fps
